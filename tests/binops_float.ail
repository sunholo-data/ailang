-- Test float binary operations including division
-- These should all be lowered to builtin function calls

-- Basic float division (should output 1.5)
3.0 / 2.0

-- Float equality with variables (OpLowering fix regression test)
-- Tests that b == 0.0 uses eq_Float instead of eq_Int
-- Expected output: true
let b: float = 0.0;
b == 0.0
