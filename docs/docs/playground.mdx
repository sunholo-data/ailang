# AILANG Playground

Try AILANG right in your browser! This REPL runs entirely client-side using WebAssembly - no server required.

:::warning Known Issue
Basic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, etc.) are currently not working due to a builtin resolver issue in AILANG v0.3.3. This affects both CLI and browser REPLs. Try the other examples below which demonstrate working features!

## Quick Examples

### Œª Lambda Functions & Let Bindings
Try typing:
```
let double = \x. x * 2 in double(21)
```

### üîç Type Inference
Check the type of an expression:
```
:type \x. x + x
```

### Œª Lambda Functions
AILANG is a functional language at heart:
```
(\x. x * 2)(21)
```

### üìù Let Bindings
Define and use variables:
```
let double = \x. x * 2 in double(21)
```

### üéØ Pattern Matching & Recursion
Calculate Fibonacci numbers:
```
let fib = \n.
  if n < 2 then n
  else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
in fib(10)
```

### üî¢ Type Classes
AILANG supports Haskell-style type classes:
```
1 + 2.5
```
*Note: This will trigger automatic type defaulting*

## REPL Commands

Special commands available in the REPL:

| Command | Description |

## Technical Details

This playground is powered by:
- **WebAssembly**: The full AILANG interpreter compiled to WASM (5.7 MB)
- **Go**: Core language implementation
- **React**: UI component framework

**Current limitations**: File I/O and module imports are disabled in the browser version. For full functionality, [install AILANG locally](/docs/guides/getting-started).
