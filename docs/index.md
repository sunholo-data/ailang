# AILANG: AI-First Programming Language

Welcome to the official documentation for AILANG, an experimental programming language designed from the ground up for AI-assisted software development.

## What is AILANG?

AILANG is a pure functional programming language that makes AI assistance a first-class citizen. It features:

- **Pure Functional Programming**: Immutable data and explicit effects
- **Algebraic Effects System**: Track and control side effects in the type system
- **Typed Quasiquotes**: Safe metaprogramming with compile-time validation
- **CSP-Based Concurrency**: Channel-based communication with session types
- **Deterministic Execution**: Reproducible builds for AI training data
- **AI-Optimized Design**: Generate structured execution traces for model training

## Quick Example

```ailang
-- Define a pure function with inline tests
pure func factorial(n: int) -> int
  tests [
    (0, 1),
    (5, 120)
  ]
{
  if n <= 1 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)
}

-- Use effects explicitly
func readAndGreet() -> () ! {IO} {
  let name = input("What's your name? ")
  print("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")
}
```

## Getting Started

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **[Installation Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/getting-started)**  
  Install AILANG and run your first program

- **[Language Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/development)**  
  Learn the basics of AILANG programming

- **[Language Reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/language-syntax)**  
  Complete syntax and semantics reference

- **[REPL Commands]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/repl-commands)**  
  Interactive development with the AILANG REPL

</div>

## Current Status

AILANG is under active development. Check the [implementation status]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/implementation-status) for details on what's currently working.

### Working Features
- âœ… Basic expressions and arithmetic
- âœ… Lambda functions and closures
- âœ… Let bindings and recursion
- âœ… Lists and basic operations
- âœ… Pattern matching (partial)
- âœ… REPL with type inference
- âœ… Type classes (Num, Eq, Ord, Show)

### In Progress
- ðŸš§ Module system
- ðŸš§ Function declarations
- ðŸš§ Effect system
- ðŸš§ Quasiquotes
- ðŸš§ Concurrency primitives

## Design Philosophy

AILANG is built on several key principles:

1. **Explicit Over Implicit**: All effects and dependencies are visible in types
2. **Correctness by Construction**: Make invalid states unrepresentable
3. **AI-Friendly**: Every language feature considers AI tooling needs
4. **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
5. **Traceable**: Complete execution history for debugging and training
