-- Working Type Classes Demo
-- This demonstrates features that are confirmed working

-- Integer arithmetic
let x = 1 + 2 in
let y = x * 3 in
let z = y - 4 in

-- Comparisons  
let cmp1 = 5 < 10 in
let cmp2 = 20 > 10 in

-- Equality
let eq1 = 42 == 42 in
let eq2 = 10 == 20 in

-- Polymorphic function
let double = \n. n + n in
let result = double(z) in

-- Final result
result  -- Returns 10 (since z = 5, double(5) = 10)
