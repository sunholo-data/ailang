-- Test lambda expressions with v2.0 pipeline

-- Simple identity function
let id = \x. x in

-- Composition of functions
let compose = \f g x. f(g(x)) in
let double = \x. x * 2 in  
let inc = \x. x + 1 in
let doubleThenInc = compose(inc)(double) in

-- Apply the composed function
let result = doubleThenInc(5) in

-- Currying example
let add = \x y. x + y in
let add10 = add(10) in
let final = add10(result) in

final
