  Write an AILANG program that computes 2 + 2 and prints the result.

  AILANG Syntax Guide (IMPORTANT - Follow exactly):
  - Module declaration: Not needed for single-file programs
  - Import: `import std/io (println)`
  - Function: `let main = { println(4) }` OR `let main = println(4)`
  - Numbers: Just write them: 1, 2, 42
  - Arithmetic: Use infix: 2 + 2
  - Print: Use `println(expr)`
  - Block syntax: If you need multiple statements: `{ stmt1; stmt2; result }`
    CRITICAL: Semicolons BETWEEN statements, NOT after the last one
  - Let binding: `let x = expr in body` OR for top-level: `let x = expr`

  Example AILANG program:
  ```
  import std/io (println)

  let main = {
    let result = 2 + 2;
    println(result)
  }
  ```

  Write EXACTLY this style. Output only the code.
