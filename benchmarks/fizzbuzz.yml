  Write a program in <LANG> that prints FizzBuzz from 1 to 100.

  Requirements:
  - Print numbers 1-100, one per line
  - For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
  - For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
  - For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number

  For AILANG:
  - Use module declaration
  - Export a main() function with ! {IO} effect
  - Import println from std/io
  - Use recursion (no for loops)

  Output only the code, no explanations.
