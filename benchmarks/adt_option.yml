  Write a program in <LANG> that:
  1. Defines an Option type (Some/None, or equivalent)
  2. Implements a safe division function that returns Option[Float]
     - Returns Some(result) if divisor is non-zero
     - Returns None if divisor is zero
  3. Tests the function with: divide(10, 2) and divide(10, 0)
  4. Prints the results:
     - For Some(value): print "Result: {value}"
     - For None: print "Error: Division by zero"

  Output only the code, no explanations.
