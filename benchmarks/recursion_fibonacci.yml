  Write a program in <LANG> that:
  1. Defines a recursive Fibonacci function: fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1, fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
  2. Computes fib(20)
  3. Prints the result

  The function MUST use recursion (not loops or memoization).
  This will be compute-intensive to test execution performance.

  Output only the code for <LANG>, no explanations.
