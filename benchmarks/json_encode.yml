  Write a program in <LANG> that:
  1. Creates a nested JSON structure representing:
     - A user object with name "Alice", age 30, active status true
     - An array of hobbies: ["reading", "coding", "hiking"]
     - A nested address object: city "Seattle", zip 98101
  2. Encodes it to a JSON string
  3. Prints the JSON string

  The output should be valid JSON with this structure:
  {"name":"Alice","age":30,"active":true,"hobbies":["reading","coding","hiking"],"address":{"city":"Seattle","zip":98101}}

  Output only the code, no explanations.
expected_stdout: |
  {"name":"Alice","age":30,"active":true,"hobbies":["reading","coding","hiking"],"address":{"city":"Seattle","zip":98101}}
