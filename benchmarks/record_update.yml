task_prompt: |
  Write a program in <LANG> that:
  1. Creates a person record: {name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "NYC"}
  2. Creates an updated version with age incremented by 1 (using record update syntax)
  3. Creates another update changing only the city to "SF"
  4. Prints all three records in format: "{name}, {age}, {city}"

  Requirements:
  - For AILANG: Use record update syntax {r | field: value}
  - For Python: Use dict update or dataclass replace
  - Each update creates a NEW record (immutable)

  Output only the code, no explanations.
