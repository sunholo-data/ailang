  Write a program in <LANG> that:
  1. Creates a list of integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
  2. Filters the list to keep only even numbers
  3. Maps the filtered list by squaring each number
  4. Computes the sum of the resulting list
  5. Prints the result: "Sum of squares of evens: {result}"

  Requirements:
  - For Python: Use list comprehensions or map/filter
  - For AILANG: Implement map/filter/fold as recursive functions
  - Show intermediate results if helpful for debugging

  Expected result: 2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 + 8^2 + 10^2 = 4 + 16 + 36 + 64 + 100 = 220

  Output only the code, no explanations.

  Sum of squares of evens: 220
