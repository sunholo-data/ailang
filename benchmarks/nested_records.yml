  Write a program in <LANG> that:
  1. Creates a nested record structure representing a company employee:
     - Employee record with fields:
       - name: "Alice"
       - age: 30
       - department: (nested record)
         - name: "Engineering"
         - code: "ENG"
         - building: 5
  2. Access and print the employee's name, department name, and building number
  3. Output format (one per line):
     "Employee: {name}"
     "Department: {dept_name}"
     "Building: {building}"

  Requirements:
  - Use nested record/object structure
  - Access nested fields through chaining (e.g., employee.department.name)

  Output only the code, no explanations.
