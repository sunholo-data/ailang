  Write a program in <LANG> that:
  1. Creates a list of integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  2. Implements a recursive function `sum_list` that sums all elements
  3. Implements a recursive function `length_list` that counts elements
  4. Prints the sum and length in this exact format:
     "Sum: {sum}"
     "Length: {length}"

  Requirements:
  - Use pattern matching for head/tail (e.g., x::xs or similar)
  - Use recursion (no loops)
  - For empty list, sum is 0 and length is 0

  Output only the code, no explanations.

  Sum: 15
  Length: 5
