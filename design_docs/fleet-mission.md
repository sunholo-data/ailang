# Fleet Mission — the loop harness is fixed by one loop, so the product loops never have to

<!--
  From design_docs/mission-charter-TEMPLATE.md. Design: design_docs/planned/m-harness-mission-loop.md
  (HD-1..HD-6 ratified by Mark 2026-09-26). Iteration 0 = ratify this charter with Mark, attended.
-->

**Type**: Long-running mission (peer of [v1-mission.md](v1-mission.md), [docs-mission.md](docs-mission.md)); advanced by a scheduled
outer loop on the always-on rig. **It fires only when there is open work.** The driver exits
before any probe or spawn when `ailang mission ticket open --count` is 0.
**North star**: product loops spend their iterations on product work. Every loop-harness defect
they hit leaves them as a ticket and comes back as a fix.
**Traces to**: [PROGRAM.md](PROGRAM.md) and [M-HARNESS-MISSION-LOOP](planned/m-harness-mission-loop.md).
Measured basis: World iterations 164–180 were 12/13 `[HARNESS]`; V1 309–348 were 18/35.
**Skill**: [.claude/skills/mission-control/SKILL.md](../.claude/skills/mission-control/SKILL.md), the SAME
unforked skill. Gate 2's **fleet branch** (`resources/gate-2-pick.md`) inverts admissibility for this
mission.
**Scheduling**: launchd `dev.ailang.mission-fleet`, registry entry [`missions/fleet.toml`](../missions/fleet.toml)
(interval 6h, boot offset 1680s). Billing guard as for every mission.
**Log**: [fleet-mission-log.md](fleet-mission-log.md), append-only, one entry per iteration.
**Human-facing reporting**: GitHub issue #1321 (live number in
`~/.ailang/state/mission-fleet-gh-issue`).

## Repo Profile (M-MISSION-PORTABILITY M2 — the per-mission values mission-control reads)

- **Repo slug**: `sunholo-data/ailang` (driver: `MISSION_REPO`)
- **Mission doc**: `design_docs/fleet-mission.md` (driver: `MISSION_DOC`)
- **Mission name / state namespace**: `fleet` (driver: `MISSION_NAME`; `~/.ailang/state/mission-fleet-*`)
- **Checkout**: `/Users/voightkampff/dev/sunholo-data/ailang-fleet`, **its own clone**, same
  reason as docs and motoko: two loops in one working tree is the concurrent-agent hazard.
- **Bookkeeping issue**: `#1321`, rotates weekly; live number in `~/.ailang/state/mission-fleet-gh-issue`
- **CI workflows Gate 3b / Gate 1 poll**: `CI` (runs on every push; no push paths filter).
- **Verify profile**: `go-compiler`, plus the mission-loop-change pre-flight as the done-gate
  (below). Harness changes live in `tools/launchd/` (bash 3.2), `internal/mission/` and
  `cmd/ailang/mission*` (Go), and the mission skills.

## STATUS (rotation rule)

Newest **3** STATUS stamps live here; older ones move to `fleet-mission-status-archive.md`.

## STATUS 2026-09-26 — ITERATION 0 pending: **charter ratification** (attended, with Mark)

Installed with its kill switch in place (`~/.ailang/state/mission-fleet.disabled`). Nothing fires
until Mark lifts it.

## CURRENT GOAL

1. **Iteration 0 (definition)**: ratify the bar and guardrails below with Mark.
2. **Then**: each fire takes the top open ticket through the inner loop (design only when the fix
   warrants one, then plan, execute, evaluate), lands it on `dev`, and resolves it.

## The bar (RATIFY with Mark at iteration 0)

- **Clause 1 — product share**: `[HARNESS]`-tagged share of product-loop iterations ≤ 10% over a
  rolling 14 days (design goal 1; measured by header scan of each `<name>-mission-log.md`).
- **Clause 2 — turnaround**: median ticket filed → resolved ≤ 48h for non-policy tickets.
- **Clause 3 — one queue**: every escalation is findable in `mission-fleet` (no scattered issues).
- **Clause 4 — idle is free**: a fire with no open tickets spends zero controller tokens.
- **Clause 5 — no regressions shipped**: every resolved ticket passed the done-gate below.

## Authority (the write scope — enforced by `tools/launchd/githooks/pre-push`)

- **May change** (loop harness): `tools/launchd/**`, `internal/mission/**`, `cmd/ailang/mission*`,
  `missions/**`, `.claude/skills/mission-*/**`, `.claude/skills/sprint-*/**`, `.pi/extensions/**`,
  `scripts/hooks/**`, `scripts/mission_*`. Also its own charter, log and index, CHANGELOG, and the
  mission guides under `docs/`.
- **May not change** (language core, refused by the guard): `internal/{parser,lexer,ast,types,
  elaborate,core,eval,vm,codegen,effects,builtins,pipeline,runtime,link,iface}/**`, `std/**`,
  `examples/**`, `benchmarks/**`.
- **Parks for Mark (HD-2a, policy class)**: any fix that changes routing, lane order, quota or
  ration thresholds, or a billing guard. File a decision row with a recommendation; take the next
  ticket.

## Guardrails (on top of the skill's Standing Rules)

- **Ticket-driven only.** The queue is `ailang mission ticket open --json` plus Mark's directives.
  No self-sourced audits, no "while I'm here". The 2026-09-21 attended hunt found harness defects
  faster than they could be fixed and never ran out.
- **Unread = open.** Never `ailang messages read` on `mission-fleet`. Close a ticket only with
  `ailang mission ticket resolve <signature> --resolution … --sha <commit on origin/dev>`.
- **Done-gate = the mission-loop-change skill's five-line pre-flight**: the surface that actually
  runs was edited; reach was confirmed (pushed, since every mission runs the pinned `origin/dev`);
  dry-run healthy **and** degraded (set `AILANG_DRIVER_PINNED=<sha>` so the pin cannot re-exec into
  another copy, design V15); `make test-launchd-drivers` green; nothing reloaded mid-iteration.
- **Every mission runs `origin/dev` until Phase 3b** (`harness-stable`). A fleet push reaches all
  loops on their next fire, so the done-gate is not optional.

## Routing policy

Shared per-role routing from `mission-control`. Overrides in `~/.config/ailang/mission-fleet.env`:

- **Executor default**: shared default (codex, then pi, then opus).
- **Evaluator**: shared default (`sonnet`); generator ≠ judge is enforced by the skill.
- **Opus before pi**: on (`MISSION_OPUS_BEFORE_PI=1`), same as World. Harness fixes are
  high-blast-radius, so capability beats flat-rate here.

## Queue (top = next; tags: [NEXT] [IN-SPRINT] [PARKED] [LANDED] [RULED OUT])

The live queue is **`ailang mission ticket open`**, not this list. Rows here record only what the
tickets cannot: parked policy questions and Phase-3 work Mark has routed here.

1. [PARKED] Phase 3a skill-resolution spike (P1–P3, design doc) · clause 5 · routed here only on
   Mark's directive.

**Document created**: 2026-09-26. Iteration 0 ratifies it with Mark before any ticket routes.
